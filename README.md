# Face-Mask-Detection
Face Mask Detection using Machine Learning
The main objective of “Face mask Detection” project is to provide some effective technology for preventing the spread of Corona virus. Primary objectives behind the development of this system are as follows: - 
• Prevent the spread of Corona virus by promoting the use of face masks with the help of effective technology to detect the face mask. 
• Help to take necessary precautions for the safety of society by predicting the future outbreaks of COVID-19. 
• Ensure a safe working environment. 
• Save the lives of people.
#Problem Statement The number of covid 19 cases are increasing day by bay there are  smaller number of system that detect mask hence Deploy a model that detect the face mask is properly wear or not this model particular build for examination hall to detect mask before going to the classroom
#Application This model can be used in exam hall that can support to take examination in safe mode. This provides detection of masks in Phase of covid 19
#Data Collection The dataset consists of various types of mask having two classes with or without mask .With 1006 images. Since the ML model requires all the data that is passed as input to be in the numeric form, we performed image processing images to train model.

This dataset consists of 1006 images belonging to two classes.
•with_mask:503 images.
•Without mask: 503 images.
.Data  Analysis
•The Dataset is Split into 3 Parts
•Training purpose images are 100 images with mask and without mask.
•Testing purpose images are 600 images with mask and without mask.
